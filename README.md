# Text File Compressor using Huffman Coding Algorithm and Java Swing

A text file compressor that uses Huffman coding and has a user-friendly interface implemented using Java Swing. This project can be used to compress and decompress text files quickly and efficiently.

## Usage

- Clone or download the repository
- Open the project in your preferred Java development environment
- Run the program
- Use the interface to select the file you want to compress or decompress
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Java Swing Library

## About Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the data being compressed. The characters with higher frequency of occurrence are assigned shorter codes, making the overall size of the compressed file smaller.

## Notes
- We can create .exe application by using exe4j wizard application
- The original file will not be deleted after compression, you may delete it manually if desired.
- The compressed file can only be decompressed using the provided decompress functionality of the program.
